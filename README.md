# vvp-pipeline-demo

This is a repository to demonstrate how to integrate [Microsoft Azure Pipleline](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/) with [Ververica Platform](https://www.ververica.com/platform-overview).

The code is based on the wiki-edits example from [the Flink DataStream API tutorial](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/getting-started/tutorials/datastream_api.html).  The following two files are the only two files required for the integration.

### azure-pipelines.yml
The pipeline configuration file

### azure-pipelines-vvp-deployment.yml
The Ververica Platform deployment specification file.
